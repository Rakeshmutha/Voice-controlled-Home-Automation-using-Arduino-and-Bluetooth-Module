Here we will control four different home appliances by voice Command. The key components of this project are Arduino, Bluetooth module, Relay module, LCD display, a smartphone, and Android App. At first, we need to install the app on our smartphone, which is easily available in the play store. This app receives our Voice command and sends it to the Bluetooth module wirelessly. The Arduino decodes this command from the Bluetooth module. Then Arduino sends a command to the Relays to control the home appliances. These four home appliances are switched on/off by eight different voice commands. The LCD module will display the status of the home appliances on or off.
